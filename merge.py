# How to use the script?
# Run the file, enter the number of duplicate entries including the original one
#
# Now enter the exact names of the duplicates
#
# Note that the first entered name will be the name of the final merged organization
# If one or more org name could not be found, the program will end abruptly, prompting the names of the entered orgs which are not present in finalData.json
#
#
# How each of the data is sanitized in final merged org?
#
#  - name
#
#     copied from the first entered org
#
#  - url
#
#     copied from the first entered org
#
#  - cat
#
#     copied from the first entered org
#
#  - tech
#
#     union of all the entered orgs
#
#  - top
#
#     union of all the entered orgs
#
#  - year
#
#     union of all the entered orgs
#
#  - project
#
#     extra care has been taken while dealing with copying number of projects data
#     for each year, if only one org has non zero number of projects, it is copied
#         if more than one org has non zero number of projects, and number of projects is not same in all the orgs, then a conflict is raised, and the user is asked to enter the correct number of projects manually for that particular year
#         (this is not likely gonna happen, as duplicate entries are because of different names in *different* years, but just in case)
#
